# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Minimum Viable Circle is a small social experiment exploring how little it takes to feel connected in an overwhelming world.

It begins with ten short stories, each inspired by a principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, permission to be boring. These are not calls to action. They’re just reflections. If one sounds like something you’ve needed to hear, you’re invited to pass it on—one-to-one, not one-to-many.

## 🌱 How it works

- Read a story, or the introduction. If something resonates, tell someone in your own words.
- Leave your email if you want to count toward the 10,000.
- When that number is reached, you’ll receive one email asking if you want to take part.
- Those who opt in will shape what happens next. Everyone else won’t hear from us again.

## 📁 Structure

- `index.md` — main site layout for GitHub Pages
- `principles/` — each principle with its story and PDF
- `podcast/` — scripts and metadata for the audio version (optional)
- `fr/` — French translations and local materials

## ✍️ Contributing

This isn’t currently accepting code contributions. But if you’d like to help:
- Read or record a story
- Translate one into another language
- Share it—only with someone who might really need it

## 🧭 License

This project is released as-is, without commercial intent. The stories and principles are free to read, share, and reflect on.
