# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Minimum Viable Circle is a small social experiment exploring how little it takes to feel connected in an overwhelming world.

It begins with ten short stories, each inspired by a principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. These aren’t calls to action—they’re just reflections. If one resonates, you can pass it on. Gently. Personally.

## 🌱 How it works

- Read a story or the introduction. If something sticks with you, talk about it with someone.
- If they’re curious, share the link.
- If you’d like to support the idea, leave your email. Nothing happens until 10,000 others do the same.
- When that number is reached, you’ll receive one message asking: do you want to get involved?
- If yes, you’ll be invited into the next phase. If no, that’s it. No further emails.
