# The Social Minimalism Experiment

This is not a movement.  
Not a philosophy.  
Not another voice asking you to perform better at being human.

It’s an experiment.

A quiet response to something many feel but few name—the hollowing out of real connection.  
Ten principles of social minimalism. Ten stories of ordinary life nudged in quieter directions.  
No demands. No promises. Just an invitation.

## ✦ What It Is
A project that explores quieter, smaller ways to connect—through reflection, not performance.

Each principle is paired with a story. Each story is shared quietly.  
If it resonates, readers can sign up. Once 10,000 people have done so, the project hands itself over.

## ✦ What Happens at 10,000
- All signups receive one email.
- They choose:
  - Step forward (and help shape what’s next)
  - Stay in the loop
  - Or step out entirely
- Those who step forward will be batched into circles.
- Each circle selects one steward.
- The stewards receive ownership of the site and project direction.
