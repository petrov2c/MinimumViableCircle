# Minimum Viable Circle (CMVM)

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

CMVM (Cercle Minimum Viable Mille) is a minimalist social experiment, born in France, designed to test what happens when 1,000 people resonate with the same signal. It’s not a campaign or a product. It’s a soft invitation—read, feel, whisper it forward.

It begins with ten short stories, each inspired by a principle of Social Minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. These aren’t calls to action—they’re patterns. If one shifts something in you, pass it on. Personally. Gently.

## 🌱 How it works

* Read a story or browse the principles.
* If something sticks, talk to someone about it. In your words.
* If they’re curious, share the link.
* If you want to support it, leave your email—optionally with a location, a ritual, or a note of intent.
* When 1,000 responses are reached, you’ll get a message. It offers three paths:

  * Join or form a live circle
  * Stay in the loop
  * Opt out entirely

That’s it. No marketing. No platform. Just small groups, learning as they go, reporting back.

## 🔀 What’s next?

If the first circles hold, the project opens to a wider field under **CMVX**—a next phase with 10,000 participants, lightweight infrastructure, and a public-facing library of stories and gestures.

We’ll get there if it’s needed. First, we see if the circle works.
