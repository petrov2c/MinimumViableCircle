# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Maybe you’ve felt it too—that subtle exhaustion from always optimizing your social life, always managing, always performing. Maybe you’re done. This project begins with a hunch: that you’re not the only one.

There are ten stories, each reflecting a different principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. You can read them, listen to them, or share them—if something resonates.

## ✋ Why this exists

This isn’t a movement. It’s a lighttrap. A small invitation for those ready to show up gently, with less.

If you’d like to support the idea, leave your email. Nothing happens until 10,000 others have done the same. There are two sign-up forms below:
- The first simply adds you to the count
- The second sends you a one-time email with the current number

That’s it. No other emails. No nudging. No noise.

## 🔟 The Principles

Each principle is paired with a story. They aren’t instructions. Just glimpses.

If one feels right, speak about it first—in your own words, in your own way. Only if it lands, share the link.

## ✉️ What happens after 10,000?

Once we reach 10,000 signups, everyone will get one email. It’ll include three choices:

1. **Yes, I want to be involved**  
   You’ll be asked for your location so we can group you with people nearby. From there, you’ll be part of a small circle of 15–20 people who choose one representative. Those representatives form the next circle. From there, the project is theirs.

2. **Keep me in the loop**  
   You won’t be active in a circle, but you’ll receive occasional updates from those who are.

3. **Sign me off**  
   You won’t hear from us again.

The original site becomes an archive. The new site—*minimumviablecircle.com*—will be handed off to the new stewards. You’ll know where to find it.

## ✅ Support it

If the idea makes sense to you, speak it aloud first. Then, if it lands—share the story, the episode, or this page.

There’s no rush. No sharing goals. Just a question:
> Who would understand this, too?
