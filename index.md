The Social Minimalism Experiment

This is not a movement.
Not a philosophy.
Not another voice asking you to perform better at being human.

It’s an experiment.

A quiet response to something many feel but few name—the hollowing out of real connection. Ten principles of social minimalism. Ten stories of ordinary life nudged in quieter directions. No demands. No promises. Just an invitation.

If it resonates, you can sign up. When 10,000 people have done so, the project hands itself over.

Principles and Stories

Each principle below links to a story (PDF and podcast) that illustrates it. If one lands with you—share it.

The Right to Not Perform {#principle-1}

You don’t have to prove your worth to be included. No need to present a version of yourself. You belong without performance.

Silence is Participation {#principle-2}

When We Reach 10,000

You’ll receive one email asking:
	1.	Do you want to participate?
	•	If yes, you’ll be asked to provide your rough location.
	•	You’ll be grouped with others nearby (or randomly if you opt out of location).
	•	Each group chooses a steward. Stewards form a council.
	•	The project—this site, the podcast, the archive—is handed over to them.
	2.	Do you want to stay in the loop only?
	•	You’ll receive updates from the council.
	3.	Do you want to sign off completely?
	•	We’ll remove you from everything.

If the project never reaches 10,000, nothing happens. The experiment stays still. That’s part of the deal.
