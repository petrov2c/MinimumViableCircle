# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Maybe you’ve felt it too—that subtle exhaustion from always optimizing your social life, always managing, always performing. Maybe you’re done. This project begins with a hunch: that you’re not the only one.

There are ten stories, each reflecting a different principle of social minimalism: presence, intentionality, and enough quiet to feel what's real. You can read them, listen to them, or share them—if something resonates.

## 📜 What happens after 10,000?

Once we reach 10,000 signups, everyone will get one email. It’ll include three choices:

1. **Yes, I want to be involved**  
   You’ll be asked for your location so we can group you with people nearby. From there, you’ll be part of a small circle of 15–20 people who choose one representative. Those representatives form the next circle. From there, the project is theirs.

2. **Keep me in the loop**  
   You won’t be active in a circle, but you’ll receive occasional updates from those who are.

3. **Sign me off**  
   You won’t hear from us again.

The original site becomes an archive. From there, we hope the stewards will find their way—toward helping more people connect to their own minimum viable circle, using this website or building on top of it elsewhere.

## 🪶 Share, quietly

If something here resonates, don’t forward the link right away.

Instead, talk about the idea in your own words. If someone leans in—then share a story, or this site. Let it stay personal.

> Some things don’t need to scale. They just need to mean something.
