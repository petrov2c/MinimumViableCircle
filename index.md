# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Maybe you‚Äôve felt it too‚Äîthat subtle exhaustion from always optimizing your social life, always managing, always performing. Maybe you‚Äôre done. This project begins with a hunch: that you‚Äôre not the only one.

There are ten stories, each reflecting a different principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. You can read them, listen to them, or share them‚Äîif something resonates.

## üß≠ The Principles and Stories

Each principle has a short description and links to a story in three formats: read, listen, or share.

---

### The right to not perform <a name="the-right-to-not-perform"></a>  
You don‚Äôt need to be interesting. You don‚Äôt need to be productive. This is about showing up as you are.

---

### The value of small signals <a name="the-value-of-small-signals"></a>  
Not everything has to be a big ask or a bold move. Connection often starts with something tiny.

### The legitimacy of local <a name="the-legitimacy-of-local"></a>  
Start with those who live near enough to share coffee or silence. Local isn‚Äôt less‚Äîit‚Äôs real.

---

### The benefit of no updates <a name="the-benefit-of-no-updates"></a>  
You don‚Äôt need to stay in touch with everyone. Some connections grow best when they rest.

### The clarity of slow timing <a name="the-clarity-of-slow-timing"></a>  
Things don‚Äôt have to escalate quickly. Trust that slowness doesn‚Äôt mean failure.

---

### The risk of asking <a name="the-risk-of-asking"></a>  
Invitations can be simple and sincere. Asking is a gift‚Äîeven if no one says yes.

---

### The decision to disappear <a name="the-decision-to-disappear"></a>  
You can leave when you need to. You don‚Äôt owe anyone endless availability.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#) | [Support this](#signup)

---

### The permission to be boring <a name="the-permission-to-be-boring"></a>  
You‚Äôre allowed to be ordinary. Comfort and repetition matter more than charm.

---

### The comfort of repetition <a name="the-comfort-of-repetition"></a>  
Sameness can be safe. Familiar rhythms are a kind of intimacy too.

---

### The absence of a hero <a name="the-absence-of-a-hero"></a>  
No one needs to lead. The project works if no one is the face of it.

## üìú What happens after 10,000?

Once 10,000 people have signed up, we‚Äôll send a single email. It offers three choices:

1. **Yes, I want to be involved**  
   You‚Äôll share your location to be grouped with others nearby. You‚Äôll form a small circle of 15‚Äì20 people. That circle picks a representative. Those reps form another. That‚Äôs how the project moves forward‚Äîcircles inside circles.

2. **Keep me in the loop**  
   You won‚Äôt join a circle but will get occasional updates from those who did.

3. **Sign me off**  
   You‚Äôre done. No more emails.

The original site becomes an archive. The project continues at [MinimumViableCircle.com](https://minimumviablecircle.com)‚Äîin the hands of those who chose to carry it forward.

## ü™∂ Share, quietly

If something here resonates, don‚Äôt rush to post or forward.

Speak about it in your own words. Let it breathe. If someone leans in, share a story. Or this site. Let it stay personal.

> Some things don‚Äôt need to scale. They just need to mean something.

## ü´£ Still curious?

If curiosity wins, there‚Äôs another form. It‚Äôll tell you how many people have already signed up. Just once.

[**‚Üí Get the count**]
