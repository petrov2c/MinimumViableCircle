# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Maybe you‚Äôve felt it too‚Äîthat subtle exhaustion from always optimizing your social life, always managing, always performing. Maybe you‚Äôre done. This project begins with a hunch: that you‚Äôre not the only one.

There are ten stories, each reflecting a different principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. You can read them, listen to them, or share them‚Äîif something resonates.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Support the idea

If the idea makes sense to you, you can quietly support it by leaving your email.

Nothing happens until 10,000 people have done the same.

## üîü The Principles

Each principle is paired with a story. They aren‚Äôt instructions. Just glimpses.

If one feels right, speak about it first‚Äîin your own words, in your own way. Only if it lands, share the link.

## üîÅ After 10,000

Once 10,000 people have quietly signed up, one email will be sent. In it, you'll choose how (or if) you want to continue:

1. **Yes, I want to be involved**  
   You‚Äôll be asked for your location so we can group you with others nearby. These circles will self-organize into a gentle network. One person from each group may act as a connector to the next level. If you choose this path, you‚Äôll receive the keys.

2. **Keep me in the loop**  
   You‚Äôll receive occasional updates from those participating more actively.

3. **Sign me off**  
   You‚Äôll be removed. No further emails.

The original site becomes an archive. A new one‚Äî*minimumviablecircle.com*‚Äîwill take over. Not run by us. Run by whoever steps forward.

## ü™û Just curious?

If you're not ready to leave your email, but you're wondering how far the idea has gone‚Äîthere‚Äôs one more form.

It‚Äôll email you the current count. Just once.

[**‚Üí Get the count**]
