# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Maybe you’ve felt it too—that subtle exhaustion from always optimizing your social life, always managing, always performing. Maybe you’re done. This project begins with a hunch: that you’re not the only one.

There are ten stories, each reflecting a different principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. You can read them, listen to them, or share them—if something resonates.

## 🔟 The Principles

Each principle is paired with a story. They aren’t instructions. Just glimpses.

If one feels right, speak about it first—in your own words, in your own way. Only if it lands, share the link.

### The right to not perform <a name="the-right-to-not-perform"></a>
Sometimes just being there is enough. No shows, no sparkle, no performance.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The value of small signals <a name="the-value-of-small-signals"></a>
A nod, a gesture, a non-reply that still means something.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The legitimacy of local <a name="the-legitimacy-of-local"></a>
What if what’s near you is already enough?  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The benefit of no updates <a name="the-benefit-of-no-updates"></a>
No news is fine. Maybe the right rhythm is no rhythm at all.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The clarity of slow timing <a name="the-clarity-of-slow-timing"></a>
Urgency is often panic in disguise. Take the long way.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The risk of asking <a name="the-risk-of-asking"></a>
Inviting someone in isn’t always clean or safe. That’s part of it.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The decision to disappear <a name="the-decision-to-disappear"></a>
Sometimes the kindest exit is quiet and permanent.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The permission to be boring <a name="the-permission-to-be-boring"></a>
You don’t have to be interesting. You just have to be real.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The comfort of repetition <a name="the-comfort-of-repetition"></a>
Doing the same thing again can be a kind of prayer.  
[Read the story](#) | [Listen](#) | [PDF](#)

### The absence of a hero <a name="the-absence-of-a-hero"></a>
There’s no central figure. There’s just us, quietly circling.

## 🌀 What happens after 10,000?

Once we reach 10,000 signups, everyone gets one email. It’ll offer three paths:

1. **Yes, I want to be involved**  
   You’ll be asked for your location. You’ll be placed in a small circle of 15–20 people. Each group chooses a rep. Those reps form the next level. The project becomes theirs.

2. **Keep me in the loop**  
   You won’t be in a circle, but you’ll receive occasional updates from the people who are.

3. **Sign me off**  
   We delete your email. You won’t hear from us again.

The current site will become an archive. The project continues at *minimumviablecircle.com* under new stewardship. You’ll know where to find it.
