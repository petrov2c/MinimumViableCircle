# Minimum Viable Circle

*A quiet experiment in not-performing.*

Maybe you’ve felt it too—that subtle exhaustion from always optimizing your social life, always managing, always performing. Maybe you’re done. This project begins with a hunch: that you’re not the only one.

There are ten stories, each reflecting a different principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. You can read them, listen to them, or share them—if something resonates.

## ✋ Why this exists

This isn’t a movement. It’s a lighttrap. A small invitation for those ready to show up gently, with less.

If you’d like to support the idea, leave your email. Nothing happens until 10,000 others have done the same. There are two sign-up forms below:
- The first simply adds you to the count
- The second sends you a one-time email with the current number

That’s it. No other emails. No nudging. No noise.

## 🔟 The Principles

Each principle is paired with a story. They aren’t instructions. Just glimpses.

- **The right to not perform**
- **The value of small signals**
- **The legitimacy of local**
- **The benefit of no updates**
- **The clarity of slow timing**
- **The risk of asking**
- **The decision to disappear**
- **The permission to be boring**
- **The comfort of repetition**
- **The absence of a hero**

You can read or listen to them in any order. If one feels right, share it with someone—but only in your own words. If they’re interested, then send them here.

## ✉️ What happens after 10,000?

Once we reach 10,000 signups, everyone will get one email. It’ll include three choices:

1. **Yes, I want to be involved**  
   You’ll be asked for your location so we can group you with people nearby. From there, you’ll be part of a small circle of 15–20 people who choose one representative. Those representatives form the next circle. From there, the project is theirs.

2. **Keep me in the loop**  
   You won’t be active in a circle, but you’ll receive occasional updates from those who are.

3. **Sign me off**  
   You won’t hear from us again.

The original site becomes an archive. The new site—*minimumviablecircle.com*—will be handed off to the new stewards. You’ll know where to find it.

## ✅ Support it

If the idea makes sense to you, share it—but only after speaking it in your own voice.

There’s no rush. No sharing goals. Just a question:
> Who would understand this, too?
