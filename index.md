# CMVM – Cercle Minimum Viable Mille

A civic experiment in social minimalism.

No brand.  
No campaign.  
No algorithm.  
Just a quiet protocol for trust.

---

## What this is

CMVM is a low-signal, high-trust invitation to connection.

1,000 people.  
10 principles.  
10 short stories.  
One question: *what happens when we choose presence over performance?*

This isn’t a platform.  
There’s nothing to “follow.”  
If you’re here, someone whispered this your way. That’s enough.

## How it works

The process is simple—and deliberately slow.

- Someone reads or hears a story.
- If it resonates, they whisper it to someone else.
- If it echoes, that person gets this link.
- If it lands, they can leave their email.

When 1,000 people are gathered, one message goes out. It offers three paths:

1. Join or form a live circle.
2. Stay quietly in the loop.
3. Opt out entirely.

No likes.  
No gamification.  
No urgency.  
Just trust, offered gently.

## The invitation

If this made something in you pause—stay with that.

There’s nothing else you need to do.  
But if the signal feels true, send it softly onward.

This is a protocol that spreads through trust.  
One conversation at a time.
