# Cercle Minimum Viable Mille  
*A quiet invitation to 1,000 humans.*

## What this is  
CMVM is a social minimalism experiment:  
A slow, trust-centered formation of a small network—1,000 people who resonate with a shared signal, and want to see what happens when intention replaces performance.

It’s not a product. Not a movement.  
Just a circle you can step into—if it calls to you.

No algorithms. No urgency. No public feeds.

## How it works  

**Stage 1** begins when 1,000 people sign up.  
Each person receives a quiet follow-up with simple choices:
- Stay in the loop.
- Join or start a local circle.
- Or opt out completely. No strings.

**The first step is simple.**  
Submit your email. That’s it.  
Optionally, you can also add:
- A word or phrase that matters to you.  
- A location (just city-level, or whatever feels right).  
- A small gesture or note of intent.

## Start here  
You can read one story or all ten. Each one lives beside a principle of social minimalism.  
They're meant to echo something real.

## This isn’t for everyone  
If you’re looking for speed, scale, or spectacle—this probably won’t make sense.  
If you’re drawn to the quiet, to small, slow connection—welcome.

> “Come if it calls to you.  
> Bring what’s alive for you.  
> Trust that the real is enough.”
