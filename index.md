# CMVM  
*Cercle Minimum Viable Mille*

A quiet invitation for 1,000 people to tune into the same signal—  
and notice what happens when trust grows in a slow, public way.

No FOMO. No funnels. No leaderboard.  
Not a movement. Not a product.  
Just a murmur.

---

## Why this?  

The world is loud. Too loud.  
This is a space for listening again—to yourself, to others, to whatever’s been trying to get through without a pitch deck.

Social minimalism is not absence.  
It’s presence—with intention, and fewer tabs open.

You don’t need to be sure. You just need to feel something.

## What happens next  

1. **Start with resonance**  
   Read a story. See what catches in your chest.

2. **Opt in, if it calls to you**  
   One email field. Quiet by default.  
   Optional: leave a note, a gesture, a location. If it helps you mean it.

3. **Wait for 1,000**  
   When the first circle forms, you choose:  
   → Join a local thread  
   → Stay in the current  
   → Step back, no pressure
