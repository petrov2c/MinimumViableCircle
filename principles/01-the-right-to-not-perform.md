# Principle 1: The Right to Not Perform

You don’t have to prove your worth to be included.

This principle is the quiet rejection of constant self-presentation.  
No charisma required. No optimized version of yourself. No social theatre.

It’s about showing up as you are—tired, messy, unsure—and still being part of the circle.  
Participation doesn’t come with performance anxiety. You’re not here to impress anyone.

Some days, just being present is enough.
