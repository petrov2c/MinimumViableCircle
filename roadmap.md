CMVM: A Builder-Centric Social Minimalism Experiment

Overview

CMVM (Cercle Minimum Viable Moi) reimagines the launch of the Social Minimalism experiment around 1,000 resonant individuals who not only feel the signal—but choose to build with it. Unlike CMVX (10,000-signup passive experiment), CMVM is active, iterative, and collaborative from the start.

Stage 1: The First Thousand

Purpose:

To gather and engage 1,000 people who resonate deeply and wish to participate in shaping the next stage of the project.

Engagement Structure:
	•	Optional email form with an open text box:
	•	Users may add their location, ritual gesture, or offer to support circle-building.
	•	Participants are encouraged to start conversations, not just share links.
	•	At 1,000 signups, a message is sent to all with a choice:
	1.	Observe quietly.
	2.	Join a test circle (online or offline).
	3.	Support design of the circle infrastructure.

Silent Protocols:
	•	Ritual gesture (e.g., no phone walks, sunset screens off).
	•	First story share must be in your own voice, not just a forward.

Stage 2: Circle Trials and Trust Infrastructure

Projected Conversion:
	•	~10% of initial 1,000 actively participate in weekly circles.
	•	Circles form online or in cities where critical mass exists.

Circle Design:
	•	~10 people per circle.
	•	When growth happens, split and replicate.
	•	Each circle chooses 1–2 rotating representatives.

Steering Layer:
	•	Representatives meet regularly.
	•	Discuss circle experiences, surface patterns, make decisions.
	•	Feedback flows both ways: top-down for strategy; bottom-up for insight.

Online Circle Layer:
	•	For those without local matches.
	•	Focus on building local capacity, experimentation, and outreach.

Stage 3: Readiness for CMVX and Wider Onboarding

Conditional Launch:
	•	Once CMVM confirms healthy trust dynamics and working circle models…
	•	CMVX launches as a broader resonance filter (10k email-only signup).

CMVX becomes:
	•	A map to find or form circles.
	•	A gentle onboarding gate to participate.
	•	A library of stories, tools, and testimonials.

Growth Vision: 100k as a Global Mesh

Long-Term Target:
	•	~100,000 signups across urbanized areas globally.
	•	Circles in major cities with redundancy.
	•	Balance of offline circles and online facilitation groups.

Circle Qualities:
	•	Local, bottom-up, resilient.
	•	Welcoming to new members.
	•	Able to process feedback and steer autonomously.

Structural Goals:
	•	Self-replicating infrastructure.
	•	Transparent governance.
	•	Human-scale trust maintenance.

⸻

Symbolic Naming
	•	CMVM.fr reflects the project’s French roots and 1,000-person builder focus.
	•	CMVX.fr remains dormant or symbolic, activated once CMVM matures.

Epilogue: The Shape of the Invitation

Not everyone will stay. Not everyone needs to. Some things don’t scale. But if you see the point of this—not in theory, but in bones—then step in.

Build one circle. Let it split. Let it speak. Let it spread.
