# CMVM:  Social Minimalism Experiment

## Overview

**CMVM** (Cercle Minimum Viable Mille) is a launch-stage experiment designed to seed the emergence of trust-based local and online circles of support. It centers on gathering *1,000 resonant individuals* who feel the signal of social minimalism and are ready to contribute to shaping its future.

This is not a campaign, a brand, or a platform. It is a filter. The goal is to identify those willing to co-create a simple, regenerative, people-first framework—starting with their own city, or their own screen.

## Stage 1: The First Thousand

### Purpose:

To find 1,000 individuals who:

* Recognize the value of minimalist, intentional social connection.
* Are willing to either participate in or support the formation of small, resilient circles.

### Participation Flow:

* Visitors are invited to submit their email.
* Optionally, they may share:

  * Their rough **location**.
  * A **ritual gesture** (a simple signal of stepping out of the noise).
  * A **note of support or intent** (e.g., to host, facilitate, or help grow).

At 1,000 signups, an email goes out with three clear paths:

1. **Circle Participant**: Join a live group (online or local).
2. **Observer**: Stay in the loop.
3. Opt out of the project.

### Cultural Cues:

* Don’t repost the story. Tell it in your own voice.
* Don’t promote. Invite, if you must, with your own resonance.
* Choose a ritual to mark your intent. A small interruption. Your off-switch.

## Stage 2: Circle Trials

### Emergent Structure:

* \~10% of the 1,000 join or form **live circles**.
* Each circle: \~10 people, meeting regularly.
* Circles split when they grow, preserving human-scale.

### Representative Layer:

* Each circle names **1 or 2 dynamic representatives**.
* These representatives meet across circles to share feedback, develop resources, and make direction-level decisions.
* Delegates change. Trust does not.

### Online Circles:

* For those without local density.
* Focused on growing local presence and helping others do the same.

## Stage 3: Readiness for CMVX

Once CMVM proves viability:

* **CMVX** (Cercle Minimum Viable X) launches as the broader, lightly-structured front door.
* 10,000 people register interest.
* Email only, no data mining.

### CMVX is:

* A **public library** of stories, gestures, and connection principles.
* A **map** showing active and emerging circles.
* A **gateway** for onboarding those curious see how it works.

## Growth Vision: The Hundred Thousand

### Long-Term Goal:

* 100,000 resonant signups distributed across cities and regions.
* Circles in every major city.
* Self-replicating local support infrastructures.

### Design Principles:

* Local-first, adaptable, resilient.
* Light footprint. No bloat. No central gatekeepers.
* Feedback flows through layers. Decisions stay human-scaled.

### Replication:

* Each new circle replicates structure.
* Trust stewards are dynamically chosen. Authority dissolves into responsibility.

## Symbolism and Naming

* **CMVM.fr**: Where it begins. The seed project, grounded in France.
* **CMVX.fr**: The signal that follows, scaling only when the base is ready.

## Epilogue: The Ask

> If this idea shifted something in you, don’t click. Don’t forward.
> Say it out loud. To one person. In your own voice.
>
> If the signal holds, sign up. Maybe say where you are. Maybe say what you’d give.
>
> If we reach 1,000, we build something. Something human. Not perfect. But real.

Let’s begin with one circle.
Let it split.
Let it echo.
Let it grow.
